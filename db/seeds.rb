Cook the chicken until it is tender (about 45 minutes). /n While you're waiting for the chicken to cook, mix the sour cream and flour in a bowl until it's free of lumps. /n When the chicken is done, temper the sour cream by transferring some cooking liquid from the chicken a spoonful at a time to the cream mixture and stirring after each addition. You want to slowly raise the temperature of the sour cream until it is very warm. /n Once the sour cream is tempered, you can pour it all back into the pot and stir to combine.
