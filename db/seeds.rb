chicken_vesuvio = Recipe.create!(name: 'Chicken Vesuvio', description: "No one really knows who invented chicken Vesuvio, a roast chicken and potato dish in white wine sauce named after Mount Vesuvius, the volcano in Campania, Italy. Some believe the dish first appeared on the menu at Vesuvio, a well-known Chicago restaurant in the 1930s; others believe it‚Äôs a riff on the roast chicken dishes that grandmothers in Southern Italy have been making for hundreds of years. (The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.) Whatever its origins, Chicagoans claim it as their own, and you can find it at almost every Italian-American restaurant in the Windy City. The dish always includes plenty of oregano and lemon juice, and usually a scattering of fresh or frozen peas for color. We reached out to La Scarola, one of the most popular Italian-American restaurants in Chicago, for their recipe, and then we adapted it for home cooks. Serve it with plenty of crusty bread, for sopping up the mouthwatering sauce. ‚ÄîMargaux Laskey", image: 'https://dm2302files.storage.live.com/y4muaslPsRuSYd1rDMdvI1VzomfWxteO5cFhfjHH5cKw4UiydCBOtDV9ne1iFjU1gLz_fTBhuO3b3vY5ZnYA-B_YLP-HVvIDXltfIBvhbqTZP36xc2nNVobMH2WGDBgsjfTcyMB3yFVHSUUHN8e6XHQQXkrng-HVtfD605OOTnYcUg5Zx6FcNkYtzpDyqCygkHt?width=600&height=392&cropmode=none', instructions: 'Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, toss the potato wedges with 3 tablespoons olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes out in an even layer. (It‚Äôs OK if some overlap). Bake, tossing gently once halfway through cooking, until the edges begin to brown, and the potatoes can be pierced with a fork but are still quite firm, about 30 minutes. (They‚Äôll finish cooking with the chicken.)/n While potatoes roast, prepare the chicken: Season the chicken with salt, pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon oregano. In a large 12-inch skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high until it shimmers. Working in batches if necessary, cook the chicken, skin-side down, until it is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate./n Reduce heat to medium-low, add the butter and garlic to the skillet and cook until the butter is melted and the garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and wine to the skillet, bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Add the peas. Pour the mixture evenly over the potatoes, then gently stir to combine. Place chicken on top of the cooked potato mixture, skin-side up. Drizzle any reserved chicken juices on top./n Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn on the oven‚Äôs broiler function, and broil until the chicken skin is golden brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle with lemon juice, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately, with plenty of the pan juices spooned over the chicken and potatoes, and crusty bread on the side.');

chicken_adobo = Recipe.create!(name: 'Chicken Adobo', description: "It is the national dish of the Philippines, and the subject of intense and delicious debate across its 7,100 islands whether made with chicken, pork or fish. Whichever, the protein is braised in vinegar until pungent and rich, sweet and sour and salty at once, then sometimes crisped at the edges in high heat, and always served with the remaining sauce. Its excellence derives from the balance of its flavors, in the alchemy of the process. Cooking softens the acidity of the vinegar, which then combines with the flavor of the meat to enhance it. Whether consumed in Manila‚Äôs heat or on the edge of a New York winter, adobo holds the power to change moods and alter dining habits. It is a difficult dish to cook just once. The recipe that follows derives from one given to The Times in 2011 by Amy Besa, who runs, with her husband, Romy Dorotan, the excellent Purple Yam restaurant in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. ‚ÄîSam Sifton", image: 'https://dm2302files.storage.live.com/y4mGG8mACu4OuFKEQ_-5zKdXXtkUlvviC_Njos6CjERzzsGS6uLzfpqSeHjS0oOsZFtO7tcImqjOK87ZQq3uFBNfm83A8fIuzCGADuHUd7JKfxSiIAjS38EgXfL7UP7PUdlG27hyPpTgS9k1pYUMBi2CEgVM0jxrw6fVMDItrciqVE1KbMM11Lr57QtS7qwmFMM?width=600&height=400&cropmode=none', instructions: "Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a large, nonreactive bowl or resealable plastic freezer bag.

chicken_sandwich = Recipe.create!(name: 'Slow-Cooker Hot-Honey Chicken Sandwiches', description: "These simple sandwiches are reminiscent of a lazy summer cookout ‚Äî but doable on a weeknight. Though slow cookers are often associated with winter, they‚Äôre great in hot weather because they don‚Äôt heat up the kitchen like ovens do. For this recipe, there is no need to add liquid to the pot before cooking, because the chicken will release moisture as it cooks. If you have a lot of liquid remaining when the chicken is done, that‚Äôs absolutely fine; just incorporate it into the shredded chicken. But if you have a little extra time, before you shred the chicken or add the honey, remove the chicken to a bowl with tongs, pour the juices into a small saucepan, and simmer until the juices are reduced by half to intensify flavor and thicken the sauce.
